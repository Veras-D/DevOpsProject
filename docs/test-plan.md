# Test Plan - Tarot Card Reader Application

## 1. Introduction

This test plan outlines the testing approach for the Tarot Card Reader application built with Avalonia UI and .NET. The application allows users to draw random Tarot cards from the Major Arcana deck.

## 2. Test Objectives

- Verify that the application correctly loads and displays Tarot cards
- Ensure the randomization of cards works properly
- Validate the application's functionality across different platforms (Windows and Linux)
- Confirm proper error handling when images are missing
- Verify the UI meets the dark mode requirements

## 3. Testing Strategy

### 3.1 Testing Levels

- **Unit Testing**: Individual components will be tested in isolation
- **Integration Testing**: Interactions between components will be tested
- **System Testing**: End-to-end functionality will be tested
- **Acceptance Testing**: The application will be tested against user requirements

### 3.2 Testing Types

- **Functional Testing**: Verify the application functionality
- **UI Testing**: Verify the user interface elements
- **Compatibility Testing**: Verify the application works on both Windows and Linux
- **Performance Testing**: Basic checks of application responsiveness
- **Installation Testing**: Verify the application can be installed and run correctly

## 4. Test Environment

- Windows 10/11 with .NET 8.0.114 or later
- Ubuntu Linux with .NET 8.0.114 or later
- Docker containers for isolated testing

## 5. Entry and Exit Criteria

### 5.1 Entry Criteria

- Source code is available in the repository
- Build is successful
- Assets are available

### 5.2 Exit Criteria

- All test cases have been executed
- No critical or high-priority defects are open

## 6. Test Schedule

- Unit testing will be performed continuously with CI/CD
